#summary Work breakdown for NHive collection development
#labels Planning,Phase-Requirements

 # NHive collection design:
  * Interface redesign;
  * Evaluate extensibility mechanism options;
  * CSTL iterator integration;
  * Evaluate LINQ support.
 # Test design:
  * Create generic unit tests for each interface; 
  * Port from existing C5 unit tests.
 # Port C5 collection classes one-by-one to their NHive equivalents:
  * Strip excessive functionality from the core collections (views, algorithms);
  * Implement new interfaces.
 # Implement generic algorithms.
  * Preferably straight port of CSTL algorithms.
 # Implement collection extension services
  * Views
  * What else?
