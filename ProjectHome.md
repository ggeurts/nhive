When starting out in 2007, NHive was intended to become a new .NET Collection Library, using the [C5 Collections](http://www.itu.dk/research/c5/) library (version 1.0.1) as a starting point and released under a more liberal licence than the original [PowerCollections](http://www.wintellect.com/PowerCollections.aspx) collections library license.

Since that time the PowerCollections library has been released under a much more liberal license [on CodePlex](http://powercollections.codeplex.com) and the [NGenerics](http://ngenerics.codeplex.com/) project has come up as another feasible .NET collections alternative with a liberal license. Therefore, the main incentive to spend time on this project no longer exists.

The code in this project may still be of interest to the following groups of developers:
  * For C5 Collection users and/or evaluators that are looking for C5 dictionary implementations that support the standard [System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s4ys34ea.aspx) interface, the code will remain available in the Subversion repository (http://nhive.googlecode.com/svn/projects/c5/tags/C5-2.0.0-alpha1/).
  * For people who like to experiment with the use of STL-like algorithms in .NET, this project contains an (early) attempt to integrate results of the [CSTL](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cstl/) project.
